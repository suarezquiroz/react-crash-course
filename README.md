## React JS Crash Course

Made step by step following Traversy Media's [React JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A71aqufiNtQ)


## Differences with the video course

- Used [Axios API](https://github.com/axios/axios) instead of [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) for the HTTP Requests
- Kept the delete option for the to-do items

## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of the Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
